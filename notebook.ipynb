    "\n",
    "- ## **Lagged Returns**  \n",
    "  (*Return* ùë°‚àí1, *Return* ùë°‚àí2, ‚Ä¶)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **a. For SVM and Neural Networks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Nonlinear Relationships:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    SVMs and NNs can capture complex, nonlinear dependencies between lagged returns and future returns.\n",
    "    Lagged returns provide the primary input for these models to learn patterns such as momentum or mean-reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Financial time series data often exhibit dependencies where past values (lagged returns) help predict future values.\n",
    "    Without lagged returns, SVMs and NNs will lack meaningful input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **b. For ARMA (or ARIMA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Model Assumption:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ARMA processes explicitly model dependencies in time series data using lagged values (AR part) and errors (MA part).\n",
    "    By default, ARMA relies on past observations and residuals, making lagged returns a natural input for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Direct Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    By including lagged returns as input features for SVM and NNs, the dataset aligns conceptually with the ARMA model, which inherently uses lagged terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## **Volatility** (e.g., rolling 10-day standard deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Why it's useful: Markets tend to exhibit volatility clustering, where high-volatility periods are followed by more high-volatility periods, and low-volatility periods follow low-volatility periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Key Technical Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**  \n",
    "  - ${SMA}_5, {SMA}_{20}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### What is SMA (Simple Moving Average)?\n",
    "    The **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** is a technical indicator that calculates the average of a given data set (e.g., prices or returns) over a specified number of periods. It smooths out price data to identify trends over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### Formula for SMA\n",
    "    $$\\text{SMA}_t = \\frac{P_{t-1} + P_{t-2} + \\ldots + P_{t-N}}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    -  $P_{t-1}, P_{t-2}, \\ldots, P_{t-N}$  are the prices for the most recent $N$ periods.\n",
    "    -  $N$ is the window size (e.g., 10 days, 20 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Why Use SMA as a Feature?\n",
    "    SMA is a powerful feature in financial modeling due to its ability to capture market trends. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. Identifies Trends\n",
    "    - SMA smooths out short-term price fluctuations, helping to identify the overall direction of the market.\n",
    "    - **Example**: A rising SMA indicates an upward trend, while a declining SMA indicates a downward trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. Acts as a Support/Resistance Level\n",
    "    - Many traders and investors view SMA as a key support or resistance level:\n",
    "      - **Above SMA**: Bullish signal (uptrend).\n",
    "      - **Below SMA**: Bearish signal (downtrend).\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. Helps in Detecting Momentum\n",
    "    - By comparing short-term and long-term SMAs (e.g., 10-day vs. 50-day SMA), you can identify momentum:\n",
    "      - **Golden Cross**: Short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA (bullish signal).\n",
    "      - **Death Cross**: Short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA (bearish signal).\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 4. Useful in Mean-Reversion Strategies\n",
    "    - Prices often revert to their mean after deviating significantly. SMA can act as a proxy for this mean, helping to predict reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### How Does SMA Enhance Predictive Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. Trend Representation\n",
    "    - SMA captures underlying trends that are not evident from raw prices or returns alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. Momentum and Reversal Patterns\n",
    "    - Combining SMA with lagged returns or volatility provides insights into both momentum and mean-reversion behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. Risk Reduction\n",
    "    - Including SMA as a feature reduces the noise in price data, making it easier for models to focus on significant patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ## **RSI** - 14-day\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### What is RSI (Relative Strength Index)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. It evaluates overbought or oversold conditions in a market. RSI values range from **0 to 100**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### RSI Formula\n",
    "    $$\\text{RSI} = 100 - \\left( \\frac{100}{1 + RS} \\right)$$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - $$ RS = \\frac{\\text{Average Gain (over n periods)}}{\\text{Average Loss (over n periods)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    ##### Key Levels\n",
    "    - **70 and above**: Overbought (price might decrease).\n",
    "    - **30 and below**: Oversold (price might increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Why RSI is Useful as a Feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 1. Detects Momentum and Reversals\n",
    "    - RSI highlights periods of strong momentum (overbought/oversold) that can predict potential reversals:\n",
    "      - High RSI (overbought): Indicates a possible downward reversal.\n",
    "      - Low RSI (oversold): Indicates a possible upward reversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 2. Captures Market Sentiment\n",
    "    - RSI quantifies the balance between buying and selling pressure, serving as a proxy for market sentiment.\n",
    "      - **Bullish Sentiment**: RSI rising above 50.\n",
    "      - **Bearish Sentiment**: RSI falling below 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 3. Enhances Predictive Power for Returns\n",
    "    - Since RSI reflects momentum and trend strength, it complements lagged returns and volatility, helping models like SVM and Neural Networks better understand market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #### 4. Widely Used in Trading Strategies\n",
    "    - RSI is a staple in trading algorithms for designing momentum and mean-reversion strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### How RSI Relates to Predicting Returns\n",
    "    - **Momentum Signals**: RSI provides momentum signals that help in understanding whether returns are likely to continue in the same direction or reverse.\n",
    "    - **Reversion to Mean**: RSI-based signals often align with mean-reversion patterns, making it relevant for predicting returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Comparison to Other Features\n",

    "    | **Feature**           | **Primary Insight**               | **Why Complement RSI?**                        |\n",
    "    |------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "    | **Lagged Returns**     | Historical return dependencies.  | RSI captures trend/momentum beyond raw returns.|\n",
    "    | **Volatility (StdDev)**| Magnitude of price movement.     | RSI adds directional bias to magnitude data.   |\n",
    "    | **SMA**                | Long-term/Short-term smoothed trends.       | RSI detects short-term overbought/oversold.    |\n",
